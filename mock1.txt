1.java:java is aobject oriented programming language, which is used to develop an web applications.
  javac:it is a tool used to compile the code.

2. jdk:Jdk means java development kit, it consists jre+jvm
   jre:jre means java runtime environment, it consists of librery+tool, and it will converts into a byte code.
   jvm:jvm means java virtual machine , it will exicute the code.

3. .java file:the file which is created by the developer it will save as .java file and it can used by annother developer 
   .class file:the jre will converts .java file to .class file 

4. java ide's:

5. variable: it is a name and allocates the memory of the value.
    types:local variable--the variable which used to declare in side the method level known as variable. ex== class Test{
															void int marks()
														         int marks=35;
                                                                                                                          }
                                                                                                                        
          Static variable--- the variables which is used to declare in the class level that is known as static variable.ex=class Animal{
																static String name;

																} 
          instance variable--- it is nothing but non-static variable, ex== class Bike{
											 String name;
														         
                                                                                       }

6. the object oriented programming language means , solving the problems of things or entity which is around us.

7. error

8.data type is size and diff value is stored in a variable.
  premitive-- byte,int,double,float,long,short,boolean. ex== int marks=35;
  non-premitive-- array, all class, String. ex== String name;

9.dot operator is a access specifier which is used to access  the method or variables from same or diff class. ex== class Watch{
																double cost;
 
																void watch(double cost){	
																this.cost=cost;
																		}
																		} 
10.speed
   write once, can run in anyware.
 

11. array is an collection of elements. class Animals{
						String[] type= {"lion", "tiger", "elephant"}; 																																	}

12.class: class is a templet or blueprint of the object.ex== class Car{
									}
   object: object is nothing but entity or real world things.


13.keywords: the words which are pre defined by java ia known as key words , and these key words has special meaning ,
	1.int
 	2.short
	3.byte
	4.long
	5.boolean
	6.this
	7 super
	8.continue
	9.return
	10.double
	11.throw
	12.throws

14.constroctor is a special method, which has class inside the class. and it has no return type,


15.
 	types;public=access specifier
              static =keyword
	      void= return type
              main= main method
              String= data type



16.class Numbers{
																					int[] num= {12,3,2,45,6,7,6};
public static void main(String[]args){
for ( int i=0, i<Number.length, i++);
System.out.println(i);
}
}	
           																											

17. ex== class Bat{																			double cost;																		String brand;																	bat(double cost,String brand)
{		
	this.cost=cost;																		this.brand=brand;
}																	
		void showInfo()	{																	System.out.println("the bat name is:"+ name);														System.out.println("the brand is:"+ brand);																																	}
}
class batStarter{

 public static void main(String[]cricket)
{
Bat bat =new Bat(1599D,"MRF");

bat.showInfo()



}
